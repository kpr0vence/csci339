Assignment 1, CSCI 339, fall 2025
1. Write a short program that can check whether a password contains a digit.
2. Split the following sentences into an array that contains only its words.

"Tom cried: 'What is going on?'. Then he left the room."
3. Input a one page long file and tokenize the text into words. Also get rid of "stop words".
	"Tokenize one paragraph"	
	Stop words - words that are very common, but don't add any context. A list of stop 
	words can be googled for the list.
4. Learn about popular datasets like Ontonotes, Gutenburg project etc. Also explore other 
datasets, or think of creating your own dataset for the course project.

Ontones- Annotate a large amount AND variety of text, including news, conversational telephone 
speech, weblogs, usenet newsgroups, broadcast, talk shows, in English Chinese and Arabic.
Included structural information and some semantic information. This kind of annotation
enables better automatic semantic (meaning) analysis, but requires a more robust and scalable
system to use the more complex annotations that enable such analysis.

Gutenberg- Project Gutenberg is a library of over 75,000 free eBooks, with a focus on older
books who's US copyright has expired. Volunteers digitized and proofread the books in 
this dataset. The Gutenberg dataset is made up of phrases from the works made available
because of the Gutenberg project. Punctuation was removed from the text, letters were 
converted to their base (common) form, and words like "chapter," "scene," and "prologue"
were removed. 

Yelp/Amazon/IMDB Reviews Dataset- Used for sentiment analysis of the reviews of the product.
The reviews are simply annotated with a 1 or 0 indicating positive or negative tone. I 
personally think this one is interesting, because people can be quite... expressive in
the way that they leave reviews, so it's a great way to start understanding the semantics
of natural languages.
