Nancy Pelosi has opened a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump - why now, and what could happen next?

For months, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives have been playing a semantics game. They wanted those who supported and those who opposed a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump to both think they were getting what they wanted.

This strategy suggested a fear by Speaker Pelosi and others that heading down the path to impeachment would put moderate Democrats facing tough 2020 re-election fights at risk and jeopardise the party's House majority.

That calculus appears to have changed, after the rapid drumbeat of new revelations about Mr Trump's contacts with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now even middle-of-the road politicians are coming out in favour of an impeachment proceeding.

Congressman Max Rose of Trump-friendly Staten Island, New York, had been a prominent holdout - but even he has softened his stance.

"This is a serious crisis, all options must be on the table, and it's time Republicans are as interested in the truth as the American people," he said in a statement.

The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. Pick your metaphor. The simple fact is that Ms Pelosi - a keen judge of the political mood within her caucus - has made the decision to shift from resisting impeachment to advocating for it.

So what changed? The prospect of impeachment has been knocked around since the early days of the Trump presidency. Over the course of the Robert Mueller inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, each new revelation and indictment were met with calls for Congress to act.

Allegations about presidential obstruction of justice and Trump campaign collusion with Russia, as well as a grab bag of others - from unconstitutional profiteering from government largess to campaign finance violations - all prompted various level of howling for the president's removal.

It took the Ukraine story, however - the possibility that Mr Trump used presidential powers to pressure a foreign government to dig up (or manufacture) damaging information on a political rival - to forge the will among Democrats to contemplate a clear and unambiguous move toward impeachment.

There are a number of possible reasons why.

It could be that the latest controversy has hit like a clap of thunder over the course of just one week, rather than the drips and drabs from the Mueller investigation. The prospect of a quid-pro-quo involving the powers of the presidency and a political rival is also an easier story to explain than Emoluments Clause violations or byzantine campaign finance infractions. Then there's the fact the Mueller inquiry was backward-looking - dealing with alleged misdeeds from the 2016 election. Many of the Democrats currently mulling impeachment weren't in Congress back then and campaigned on other issues in the 2018 mid-term elections.

The Ukraine story, on the other hand, is about allegations of an ongoing attempt to use the presidential powers for personal political benefit - events that have occurred on their watch, as it were. It's about requesting a foreign government to give information that could help the president win a future election - not about what a foreign government had done to influence a past one.

Accusations of sour grapes, or of relitigating past campaigns, don't apply here.

Wait, what's this Trump Ukraine story about?
What would impeachment take?
This controversy also once again highlights the blurred lines between the personal and the official that has frequently typified the Trump White House.

Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's personal lawyer, was the president's point person in pressuring Ukraine to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Although the former New York City mayor said he was in contact with the State Department prior to his August trip to Spain to meet with a Ukrainian official for this purpose, it wouldn't be surprising if the Ukrainians were confused about whether this was a formal request from the US government or a more unofficial effort.

The path forward is uncertain. The president has already announced that he will release the transcript of his 25 July phone conversation with Zelensky. While that won't be enough for Democrats, perhaps the White House will do more to accede to Congress's requests, thereby dousing the hottest of the impeachment fires.

Opinion surveys could show the latest drama is taking a toll on one party or the other, causing political will to crumble. A YouGov poll said 55% of Americans would support impeachment if it was confirmed that President Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to push the country's officials to investigate Mr Biden.

Or both sides could dig in for a long, gruelling battle that could drag into the darkest days of winter, as an embattled president gears up for a re-election fight that could be conducted in the shadow of a constitutional crisis.

The couple are due £8,000 in wages next Monday, but do not expect to receive them on time.

Hayley added: "It was a good wage between us. Dan had worked overtime, we had a holiday to Florida in May to pay for, now we can't afford it.

"We have a bit of savings to cover the mortgage, and we are lucky we have family that can help in the short term, but we desperately need to get Dan, the main breadwinner in our house, a new job by Christmas."

The couple from Manchester have two young daughters, aged five and three, to provide for.

She added that crew and pilots had been supporting each other with advice on signing on for jobseekers' allowance and help with mortgage and council tax repayments.

"It's a very real and immediate problem we have - we all have mortgages going out next week that we can't pay for", she said.

"I don't think there's a fix within the week. I know a lot of crew have been ringing various organisations and just crying. I rang my gym earlier on Tuesday to cancel my membership and just cried down the phone to them."

The couple are expecting to receive fact sheets and individual case numbers by post so they can reclaim money owed to them.

'Vulnerable staff abandoned'
The mother of a Thomas Cook entertainment worker based in Cyprus says "vulnerable" young staff have been left to fend for themselves.

The woman, who did not wish to identify herself or her daughter, told the BBC that she had to pay £480 for the 19-year-old to fly back to the UK.

She said: "There is no one helping the other vulnerable young people who are out in other countries.

"The workers who are left in these countries have been on minimum wages of €500 (£440) per month. They don't have the means to get home."

"They were put in touch with the British consulate, and were told there is nothing they could do for them because they're not Atol or Abta protected, and that it was up to the company's insurance to get them back home.

"When she arrived into work yesterday she was told she had to work, even though the company had gone into administration overnight.

"They said they needed everyone who was part of the team to stay until the last Thomas Cook holidaymaker has left.

"Anyone who decided not to stay had to write a letter of resignation."

The woman's daughter was on a six-month contract with the company, and believes she will not be eligible to claim back any lost pay.
