Because, thought Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef became very distant. "They'd tell him at the airport." Piggy shook his head, put on his flashing glasses and looked down at Ralph. "Not them. Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead." Ralph pulled himself out of the water, stood facing Piggy, and considered this unusual problem. Piggy persisted. "This an island, isn't it?" "I climbed a rock," said Ralph slowly, "and I think this is an island." "They're all dead," said Piggy, "an' this is an island. Nobody don't know we're here. Your dad don't know, nobody don't knowâ€•" His lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist. "We may stay here till we die." With that word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding effulgence. "Get my clothes," muttered Ralph. "Along there." He trotted through the sand, enduring the sun's enmity, crossed the platform and found his scattered clothes. To put on a grey shirt once more was strangely pleasing. Then he climbed the edge of the platform and sat in the green shade on a convenient trunk. Piggy hauled himself up, carrying most of his clothes under his arms. Then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk near the little cliff that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled reflections quivered over him.
